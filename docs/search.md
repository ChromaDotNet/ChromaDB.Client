# Search

The servers that serve the Search API: [COMPATIBILITY.md](COMPATIBILITY.md#chroma-cloud).

```csharp
var results = await collectionClient.SearchAsync(new ChromaSearch
{
	Where = ChromaWhereOperator.GreaterThanOrEqual("year", 2021),
	WhereDocument = ChromaWhereDocumentOperator.Contains("apple"),
	Rank = ChromaRank.Knn(new([0.1f, 0.2f, 0.3f])),
	Limit = 10,
	Select = [ChromaSearchKeys.Document, ChromaSearchKeys.Score, "title"],
});
foreach (var result in results)
{
	Console.WriteLine($"{result.Id} {result.Score} {result.Document} {result.Metadata?["title"]}");
}
```

`ChromaSearch` holds the filters, which combine with `$and`, the ids, the ranking, the page and the fields to return. Without `Select`, a search returns only the ids. The records with the lowest score come first, but with `ChromaRank.HybridRrf` as the whole rank, whose results come with the fused score, positive, highest first. Inside an expression, like `HybridRrf(...) * 0.5`, the score comes as Chroma sends it, lowest first.

`ChromaRank` builds the ranking:

- `Knn` ranks by distance from a vector;
- `Value`, `Sum`, `Multiply`, `Max`, `Min`, `Abs`, `Exp`, `Log` and the operators `+ - * /` combine rankings;
- `Rrf` fuses several rankings, built as the Python client builds it.

```csharp
var fused = ChromaRank.Rrf([ChromaRank.Knn(vector1, returnRank: true), ChromaRank.Knn(vector2, returnRank: true)]);
var perCategory = new ChromaSearchGroupBy(ChromaSearchAggregate.MinK(3, ChromaSearchKeys.Score), "category");
var many = await collectionClient.SearchAsync([new ChromaSearch { Rank = fused, Limit = 5 }, new ChromaSearch { GroupBy = perCategory, Rank = fused }]);
```

`ChromaSearchGroupBy` keeps, for each value of the metadata keys, the records the aggregate chooses. Several searches go in one request, and their results come back in order. `ToString()` of a `ChromaRank` returns its JSON, where a text query of `SparseKnn` appears as text; `SearchAsync` sends its sparse vector.

`SearchAsync(search, ChromaReadLevel.IndexOnly)` leaves out the records not indexed yet. `ChromaSearchAggregate.MinK` keeps the records with the lowest values of the keys, the best ranked with `ChromaSearchKeys.Score`, and `MaxK` those with the highest.

## Hybrid search with BM25

```csharp
var collection = await client.CreateCollectionAsync(new ChromaCollectionDefinition("articles")
{
	Schema = new ChromaCollectionSchema().WithSparseVectorIndex("doc_bm25", ChromaSearchKeys.Document, bm25: true, new ChromaBm25().Reference),
});
var collectionClient = client.GetCollectionClient(collection);
await collectionClient.AddAsync(new ChromaRecords(ids) { Embeddings = embeddings, Documents = documents });
var results = await collectionClient.SearchAsync(new ChromaSearch
{
	Rank = ChromaRank.Rrf([ChromaRank.Knn(queryEmbedding, returnRank: true), ChromaRank.SparseKnn(queryText, "doc_bm25", returnRank: true)]),
	Limit = 10,
	Select = [ChromaSearchKeys.Document, ChromaSearchKeys.Score],
});
```

- **What `ChromaBm25` computes:** the BM25 vectors as the Python client computes them, `chroma_bm25` with the Snowball English stemmer of snowballstemmer 3.1.1. The same text gives the same indices and values in .NET and in Python, so a collection written by one is searched by the other.
- **How it was tested:** against the Python client on more than 5,000 texts, with the characters of every Unicode script that Python 3.13 knows, on .NET 8 and on .NET Framework, outside the CI. On every change, `ChromaBm25Tests` compares the vectors of a few texts with those of Python. It follows the Unicode rules of Python from its own tables, not those of the runtime.
- **What the client computes, as the Python client does:**
  - In `AddAsync`, `UpdateAsync` and `UpsertAsync`, the vectors of each sparse vector index of the schema with a source key and `chroma_bm25`, from the document or from the text in the metadata key, with the settings of the schema. A record whose metadata already has the key keeps its vector. The records and the metadata you pass do not change.
  - In `SearchAsync`, the vector of the text of `SparseKnn(queryText, key)`, with the function of the index of the key.
  - The schema comes with the collection, from `CreateCollectionAsync` or `GetCollectionAsync`. A collection client created from an id alone has no schema, so a text query throws a `ChromaException`. So does a function other than `chroma_bm25`, unless the metadata has the vectors.
- **By hand:** `new ChromaBm25()` with the same settings, or `Bm25Function` of the index, gives the vectors to put in the metadata or in `SparseKnn`. `Embed(text)` returns the vector of a text, and `Reference` declares the function in the schema.
- **Other functions:** `ChromaEmbeddingFunctionReference.Known(name, config)` declares another function that the clients of Chroma know. The client only declares it.
- **Records without the terms of the query:** Chroma Cloud ranks them too, among the `limit` of `SparseKnn`, with the score 1, one minus the dot product. With `returnRank` they take the next positions, so in `Rrf` they get points from the sparse part as well. `ChromaRank.HybridRrf(embedding, text, key, limit)` fuses the dense search and the BM25 search of the text so that only the records with a term of the text get points from it; the others keep the order of the dense search.
